there are two files in this.
Decode_IR.ino - upload this sketch into arduino board with proper connection according to code.
                open serial monitor then press any key on remote you want to assign task to
                note down the numerical value as it will be used later
                note as many values as you need and then you can move to next part
                
IR_One_LED.ino - this is an example file I created quickly, as I was not able to find original file
                replace the numericaal values with yours as you noted down earlier
                do whatever task you want within if(result.value== ){   } and have fun :)
